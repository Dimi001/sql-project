/*
Create a database with 3 tables:

1) Teams
2) Players
3) Playerscores

Create:
- a relationships between tables, assuming that each team has several players and each player has several results (playerscores).
- a query adding random data to all of the tables.
- a query that changes the data of one selected player in the players table.
- a query that removes one selected record from the playerscores table.
- a query that sums the number of records in the teams table.
- a query showing the first 3 records of the teams table sorted in ascending order by the team name.
- a query showing the sum of the players' points for each team.
